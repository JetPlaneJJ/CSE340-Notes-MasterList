# Design Tips for Motor Control
  - Start of important content in slides: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk06/people-motor.html#11
  - Summary slide: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk06/people-motor.html#60

  1. Small --> large targets (maximize size)
  2. Commonly used things together (minimize distance)
  3. Infinite edges
  4. Pie menus for expert tasks
  5. Snapping
  6. Motor Size vs Visible Size (important things bigger)
  
# Design Tips for Vision
- Summary slide: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk02/people-vision.html#78

1. Small object --> NO BLUE
2. Older users --> NO BLUE!!!!!!!!
3. Contrast = HIGH
4. Less Saturate
5. Redundant cues --> traffic signs (consistent, not dependent on hues)
6. Make things DISTINCT
7. Use small multiples (star rating system, airplane safety instructions consistent human drawing)
8. Can't change response time? Manage expectations. --> "hey here's a loading bar to tell your download progress"
9. Replace subtle changes with obvious ones (You're trying to sign up for account but there's an error, show BIG + RED BOX)
10. Well-tested visual GROUPING strategies
11. Less options
12. Recognition not Recall (this button's caption says "home" instead of obscure home symbol user doesn't know)

# Accessible Design Tips (Tracy Tran Lecture)
- PDF: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk03/accessibility-and-inclusive-design.pdf

1. Recognize exclusion (know that others have diff abilities + background)
2. Learn from diversity (diverse training data... etc)
3. Solve for one --> helps many others too!

# Application Design Principals
  - Start of important content: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk07/interaction.html#33
  - Summary slide: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/20sp/slides/wk07/interaction.html#44

  1. Consistency (Record This Record That... Stop recording but still "tricked" into accepting????)
  2. Affordances (make the window side have a "groove" appearance so users can think it's easy to grab)
  3. Visible Conceptual Model/Feedback (facebook "blowing up" thumbs up, checkbox highlighted after checked)
  
 # Gulf of Evaluation vs Gulf of Execution
  - Useful read: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/gulf-of-execution-and-gulf-of-evaluation
  - TLDR; Gulf of EVAL = user fails to EVALUATE the complete list of possible functionalities, Gulf of EXEC = user tries to EXECUTE some action that doesn't exist in the system

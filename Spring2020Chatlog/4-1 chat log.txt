10:29:43	 From  SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : great, thanks.
10:30:12	 From  Vladimir Ovechkin : at what time will the first assignment be released? It only says the date on the course website.
10:30:42	 From  Brian Lee : It will be released today
10:38:10	 From  JIAXIN LI : I tried to login Ed. And it said that it will send me a login link, but I haven’t received that. Does anyone has the same problem?
10:38:18	 From  Joshua Watrous : So, basically, for the git setup, all we should do if we're on windows is download git bash for windows and make sure we can clone into GitLab? (ignoring the atom bits)
10:39:13	 From  Christina Zhang : will section be recorded as well?
10:39:34	 From  Brian Lee : I believe the section will not be recorded
10:39:49	 From  Joshua Watrous : Also, could you post the TA office hour times on the course website?
10:41:09	 From  Jasper Palmer : We do not have the OH links on the Website due to privacy issues with the Zoom links, that is why we keep them on canvas and Ed :)
10:43:10	 From  Frost Yockey : GUI

11:01:55	 From  Joshua Watrous : I'm still a little confused on the difference between tookits / API / IDE ?
11:02:48	 From  ZEYNEP TOPRAKBASTI : Can you clarify difference between toolkist and high level tools? And also the windows System is clear on computers but I am confused how they exist on mobile devices
11:02:58	 From  Frost Yockey : Is there some explicit differentiation between High level tools and Toolkits?
11:02:59	 From  Brian Lee : IDE is an integrated development environment, it basically what you will be using to program and run your program on the emulator or ur phone
11:03:56	 From  NIKOLAI A SCHEEL : How important is code style/idioms for grading (compared to correctness)?
11:04:43	 From  Brian Lee : Style isn't as important in this class but your code should still be neat!
11:04:52	 From  JIAXIN LI : How about the grading for reflection?
11:04:56	 From  NIKOLAI A SCHEEL : Thanks!
11:05:03	 From  JIAXIN LI : Do we have detailed rubrics for grading?
11:05:17	 From  Brian Lee : basically follow good coding styles learned in 143 but we don't scrutinize it as much
11:05:32	 From  ZEYNEP TOPRAKBASTI : Thanks Brian :D 
11:05:40	 From  JIAXIN LI : Thank you
11:05:47	 From  Brian Lee : Yes, rubrics for grading will be up on the website later
11:06:00	 From  JIAXIN LI : Ok :)
11:06:10	 From  Jasper Palmer : They should be at the bottom of every spec!
11:06:35	 From  Brian Lee : for reflections, as long as you put in time for a thoughtful answer, you will be fine
11:06:51	 From  JIAXIN LI : I see

10:28:12	 From Lauren Bricker : What's your favorite mid-afternoon snack.
10:28:46	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : almonds and tea
10:29:13	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : black
10:29:33	 From Michelle : Ooh nice! I'm a fan of jasmine :D
10:29:46	 From Jay Lin : i miss bubble tea
10:29:51	 From Michelle : +1
10:31:47	 From Ally Zitzka : @Jay retweet
10:38:26	 From Yazan Maini : does taking sway quizzes come under the participation grade?
10:42:55	 From Ofek Inbar : What about method references?
10:43:04	 From Ofek Inbar : We can re-use lambdas that way
10:44:29	 From Sophie Tian : @Yazan: Yes. It also benefits your learning :)
10:46:40	 From Sophie Tian : @Ofek: I am guessing you can do that.
10:50:54	 From Sophie Tian : You can also assign a lambda to a variable
10:52:15	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : I thought it was "implements" ?
10:52:27	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : (not extends) ?  for the interface. nm.
10:54:19	 From Sophie Tian : It can be either way. It depends on which language you use. Some languages say “implement” some say “extend”. The concepts are the same :)
10:58:40	 From Jasper Palmer : The `extends` keyword is mainly used to extend a class (i.e. to create a subclass in Java), while `implements` keyword is used to implement an interface in Java, however, `extends` can also be used by an interface for extending another interface. So in this case `extends` fulfills the purpose of `implements`
10:58:56	 From Sophie Tian : ^^
10:59:30	 From XINKAI ZHANG : should you do a depth first search instead?
11:01:40	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : post order is a depth first approach, I think
11:03:40	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : how is bubble out different from bottom to top?
11:03:52	 From Michelle : @Xinkai Scott is correct that post order traversal is depth first
11:04:21	 From XINKAI ZHANG : Oh I see
11:04:24	 From XINKAI ZHANG : Thanks
11:09:52	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : framerate
11:09:55	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : 30/s min
11:12:55	 From NATASYA JULIETTE : first and second one
11:13:35	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : looks weird. "b" goes two different routes.
11:14:24	 From Joshua Watrous : shouldn't the self loop be on node C?
11:14:32	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : right
11:14:41	 From Ofek Inbar : It could be an NFA
11:14:54	 From Ofek Inbar : multiple routes for an input are valid in that case
11:19:12	 From Sophie Tian : @Scott: With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.

With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
11:21:43	 From NATASYA JULIETTE : thank you ;)
11:21:48	 From Lynn Kim Nguyen : thank you!
11:21:49	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : but 'bottom up' seems similar to bubbling out to me
11:22:03	 From Thevina Dokka : thank you!
11:22:36	 From UNNATI GOYAL : I had a question about the accessibility assignment. Can I ask it right now ?
11:22:50	 From SCOTT EDWARD WEAVER : fair enough. ty

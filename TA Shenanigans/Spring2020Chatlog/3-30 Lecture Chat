10:51:18	 From Zeynep Toprakbasti : are the practıce quızzes counted ın our grade
10:54:09	 From Nikolai Scheel : Where will we do practice exams?
10:54:52	 From Yating : Can you tell us a little bit about the format of the quiz?
10:56:39	 From Zeynep Toprakbasti : Can you elaborate on "documentation is required"? Would you like us to be explicit about the implementation details and our thought process throughout the code
10:56:45	 From NIKOLAI A SCHEEL : thank you
10:56:56	 From carl : Is it going to be on canvas or polleverywhere? Thank you
10:57:39	 From Yating : Does that mean we only need to document on collaboration? Or all the implementation?
10:59:18	 From carl : Will only partial credit be given if we look at outside resources or collab?
11:02:18	 From Brian Lee : No you will still receive full credit
11:02:20	 From Jasper Palmer : In general this course does not require comments as part of the assignment rubric, however, you should always be documenting collaborations. As long as you are documenting collaborations you will not receive a reduction in credit on an assignment!
11:10:37	 From Shile Wen : I heard last quarter this class used React towards the end of the class, Will that be the case for this quarter as well?
11:11:00	 From Ofek Inbar : I LOVE Flutter :) <3
11:11:02	 From Brian Lee : No, we did not use react we work with Java throughout the entire quarter
11:12:31	 From carl : Just curious - will the first assignment be posted this week or next week?
11:12:56	 From Yanglu Shu : do we need to find the peers by ourselves?
11:13:01	 From Ryan : The partner for peer review is assigned? Or we can choose whom to work with?
11:13:12	 From Michelle : It will be assigned
11:13:24	 From Ryan : Thank you!
11:13:31	 From carl : agreed, thank you
11:13:37	 From Yanglu Shu : thanks
11:13:47	 From Christina Zhang : how is EPA evaluated?
11:14:31	 From Jasper Palmer : The peer reviews are all anonymous and we send them all out so you will just receive an email! We will go into it more closer to the first peer evaluation
11:14:42	 From Yanglu Shu : thanks
11:16:09	 From Simona Liao : Hi! For the Android version, do we have to use Nougat or version
11:16:16	 From Simona Liao : Or version 10 is also okay?
11:16:24	 From Simona Liao : thanks!
11:16:36	 From Sophie Tian : Any versions above 8 should work
11:17:04	 From Simona Liao : Thank you!
11:17:05	 From Jasper Palmer : Yes! Q (Version 10) will work and you can use your own Android phone if you have one instead of the emulator!
11:18:25	 From carl : Video was really good (+1)
11:18:46	 From Edan Sneh : Where do you find the video?
11:19:00	 From Brian Lee : it should be on the course website
11:19:18	 From Michelle : Link: https://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/human-computer-interaction/
11:19:53	 From Edan Sneh : thanks
11:21:30	 From ZUO WANG : Does the API level for Nougat matter? Are both 24 and 25 okay?
11:22:22	 From Brian Lee : the api level shouldn't matter, I would just use the latest one just to be safe
11:22:26	 From Jasper Palmer : I could be wrong but I think API 24-30 should work fine!
11:22:35	 From NIKOLAI A SCHEEL : thanks
11:22:39	 From Thevina Dokka : where can we get the phones?
11:22:43	 From ZUO WANG : thanks!
11:22:43	 From My Tran : @carl the first assignment will be posted this week :)
11:22:44	 From Ryan : Thank you!
11:22:52	 From DENNIS TOEPKER : thanks!
11:23:24	 From Laura Mary Deboldt : thanks!! first day went great :)
11:23:26	 From Kashish Aggarwal : When are the recordings posted usually?
11:23:36	 From Thevina Dokka : ok thank you!
11:23:37	 From Xinjie Huang : Are there provided steps on how to set up Android Studio/emulators on laptop?
11:23:41	 From linh dao : can any android phones work for the assignment?
11:23:47	 From Lauren Bricker : They will be available on canvas after lecture
11:23:50	 From Simona Liao : Will the poll everywhere count towards the EPA scores? I don’t know why but my poll everywhere is acting weird and I can’t see the poll questions
11:24:27	 From Kashish Aggarwal : Ok thanks!
11:24:53	 From Jasper Palmer : We will go over android studio setup in section but you can also look at the documentation on the course website!
11:24:54	 From Brian Lee : yes please check the ed site for guide on setting up android studio and emulators
11:25:14	 From Jasper Palmer : Any android phone should work!

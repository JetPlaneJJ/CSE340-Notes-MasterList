09:54:18	 From XINJIE HUANG : Do we have to keep the TODO text there when we submit?
09:54:57	 From Jay Lin to My Tran (Privately) : what about the animation part
09:54:58	 From XINJIE HUANG : thanks!
09:55:17	 From My Tran to Jay Lin (Privately) : i think taylor supposed to talk about it
09:55:21	 From Jay Lin to Taylor Gotfrid (Privately) : uh do you want to go over this part
09:55:44	 From JIAXIN LI : I have 2 questions on Ed that remain unanswered, can you answer that after the session? I do not think I can post it again to remind you.
09:56:07	 From Jay Lin : ok, will check
09:56:11	 From JIAXIN LI : Thanks
09:58:46	 From Ally Zitzka : can you go over the difference between the animations again?
10:00:26	 From Ally Zitzka : oooo ok thank you
10:00:30	 From Yanglu Shu : what’s the difference between a View and a canvas?
10:00:36	 From My Tran : We will learn more about xml later too :)
10:01:23	 From Jay Lin : View —> all the “objects” you add on the screen
10:01:28	 From Ally Zitzka : so like if it’s art or whatever, the canvas would be the canvas and the view would be like a bush?
10:01:30	 From Jay Lin : Canvas —> your screen
10:01:31	 From Yanglu Shu : i thought that each view gets its own canvas
10:02:07	 From Jay Lin : @Ally yeah, kinda like starting out with an empty canvas,
10:02:24	 From UNNATI GOYAL : I added custom images to drawables and now when I am adding more than 1 image, my app crashes. How do I rectify that
10:03:04	 From Ben Lin : are there any other useful/frequently used propertyName(like alpha, x) for animating stuff?
10:03:08	 From UNNATI GOYAL : How do you join images like we joined to make the heart
10:03:17	 From Jay Lin : ^ make size of images smaller (might fix your problem)
10:03:54	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : what is the difference between “x” and “translationX” properties?
10:04:18	 From Jay Lin : @Unnati Goyal: The “heart” image is just a bunch of views ontop of each other
10:04:27	 From Jay Lin : not “joining” image files or anythnig
10:04:31	 From XINJIE HUANG : Does the X property of the view represent the left-most edge of the bounding box?
10:04:46	 From Yanglu Shu : ok thanks!
10:06:54	 From Jasper Palmer : https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation#views
10:07:08	 From Nick A Harlow : https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation
10:07:13	 From Ben Lin : thank you!
10:07:15	 From Nick A Harlow : Is a good overview of animation as well
10:08:07	 From Allyson Ely : Is there a way to delay an animation?
10:08:25	 From Allyson Ely : thanks!
10:08:35	 From Andrea Muljono : Can we save the part2 video as an .mp4?
10:08:57	 From Andrea Muljono : Thanks!
10:10:19	 From David Chen : Were you drinking water or coffee
10:10:28	 From UNNATI GOYAL : I accidentally changes one of the files that I wasn’t supposed to but I changed it back to the original. Is that fine ?
10:10:59	 From UNNATI GOYAL : how do you revert
10:12:16	 From UNNATI GOYAL : Thanks!
10:13:09	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : doesn’t git checkout also revert file
10:13:16	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : to last commit
10:13:34	 From UNNATI GOYAL : I tried to reduce the size of the images and it still crashes
10:13:51	 From UNNATI GOYAL : It’s the same
10:14:04	 From UNNATI GOYAL : I’ll try that
10:14:06	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : git-checkout - Switch branches or restore working tree files
10:14:22	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : it’s what it says when you do git status
10:14:34	 From Vladimir Ovechkin : bye
10:14:46	 From Ben Lin : is there a difference between setting params directly and using the method setParams?like imageView.getLayoutParams().height = 2 &ViewGroup.LayoutParams params = imageView.getLayoutParams();params.height = 2;imageView.setLayoutParams(params);
10:14:47	 From Jay Lin : Random note, git reference: https://www.datree.io/resources/git-commands
10:15:06	 From UNNATI GOYAL : It’s just my images
10:15:32	 From Ben Lin : thank you
10:15:42	 From Jay Lin : 200x200px images (in the original Doodle)
10:15:48	 From Jay Lin : maybe strive for that number
10:16:00	 From Jay Lin : jpeg
10:16:50	 From Jay Lin : And remember to git add all the images you want to submit too
